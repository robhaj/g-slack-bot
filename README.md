# gBot
This is a slack bot intended to help consolidate galvanize curriculum. This bot will periodically message instructors asking for relevant resources they've used for a particular subject. Respond with a list of links which the bot can save under that subject. This will be used to compare to the existing resource list and finally consolidate old and rarely used ones.
